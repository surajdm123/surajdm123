I'm currently pursuing my master's in Computer Science from NC State University at Raleigh, NC. 

I am an inquisitive software developer with 3+ years of experience and have a keen interest in software development, theoretical computer science, algorithms and problem solving.
I am also an out of the box thinker who loves breaking down big problems into smaller actionable items and brainstorming innovative solutions.
